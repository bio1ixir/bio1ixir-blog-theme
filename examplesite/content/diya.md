overview: "It was discovered that  Ideonella sakaiensis bacteria of genus Ideonella and family Comamonadeceases are naturally capable of degrading PET plastic into Terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol  by releasing PETase enzyme .They release enzyme outside the cell  to degrade PET and utilize it as Carbon and energy source. Since Ideonella sakaiensis is poorly characterized and even because of limitations like pH,temperature and growth conditions they cannot be used to genetically engineer for more PETase production.E.coli is most studied organisms with known gene sequences and rapid growth rate under several conditions,thatâ€™s why it has been chosen as Model organism to be genetically engineered using Recombinant Dna Technology and we can use E Coli plasmid as a vector to carry PET degrading gene."
