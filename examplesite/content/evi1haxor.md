overview: "Having my room just beside the garden, I evoked my hatred toward these little sanguivorous flies. Just when India is struggling with a global pandemic, yearly malaria crisis may come on the doorstep any time now. Although the government does what it has to, but I ask, is it the best we can do? Every year, literally waiting for it to hit us? Canâ€™t we just completely eradicate all mosquitoes or something once and for all? As far as vector-borne diseases are concerned, vanishing off a complete species just because they steal your blood is not worth the risk that the ecosystem has to suffer because of this action. So what if we could selectively kill those mosquitoes which are infected by the pathogen- The vectors. Because ultimately those are the ones which can spread the disease."
