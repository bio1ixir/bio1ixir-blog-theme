overview: "India’s economy is farm dependent with monsoon being a crucial source of water supply necessary for agriculture, industry and households in the country. A poor monsoon season can have a rippling effect on India’s economy and growth. Rain causing bacteria like P.Syringae can help cause rain and can work as an economically feasible solution. But keeping in mind that such bacteria are plant pathogens, we use recombinant DNA technology for help."
