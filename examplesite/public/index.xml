      <description>Originally answered on Quora- How is B.Tech. in Bioengineering program at IIT Jodhpur with respect to faculty, internship, and student exchange programs?
 B.Tech. in Bio engineering (formerly Biotechnology) at IITJ has seen its first undergraduate batch in 2018. As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, it makes the senior most batch of this branch in sophomore year. Many things are yet to happen to its first batch itself to which respect they can narrate the know-hows to the world.</description>

 Scientific methods That would be so awful if I start explaining to you the importance of Science and over-the-top deal of certainty in scientific methods. So in laymen&amp;rsquo;s words, you observe, enquire, do background research, make hypothesis, undertake rigorous experiments, formulate and test your hypothesis, modify your hypothesis and make conclusions accordingly to have a rich and juicy theory.</description>
